## Technical requirements

- Results should come from OpenAIâ€™s completions API.
- Each result should include at least the original prompt you entered and the response from the API.
- Responses should be stored in order of newest to oldest.
- The HTML that ends up being served client-side should be accessible and semantic 

## Extras
- Save responses if the user leaves or reloads the page
- Let the user choose the AI engine from a select box
- Add some presets for the user to quickly send a good prompt
- Make the app more specific to a single purpose. See the OpenAI Examples and prompt design docs for inspiration.
